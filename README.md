# Activity Recognition of Weight Lifting Exercises - Simple implimentation with R

With Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit, you can collect a lot of personal activity data cheaply. These devices are part of the quantified self movement, a group of enthusiasts who measure themselves periodically to better their health, identify behavioral trends, or be tech geeks. People often measure how much they do something, but rarely how well. Your purpose in this project is to leverage accelerometer data from six participants' belts, forearms, arms, and dumbells. Five strategies were given to lift barbells correctly and poorly.Six young health participants performed one set of 10 unilateral dumbbell bicep curls in five ways: exactly according to the specification (Class A), throwing the elbows to the front (Class B), lifting and lowering the dumbbell halfway (Class C, D), and throwing the hips to the front (Class E).The other four classes represent common mistakes, but Class A represents the exercise execution. An experienced weightlifter supervised participants to ensure they simulated the correct motion. Six 20- to 28-year-old men with little weightlifting expertise did the routines. A light dumbbell (1.25 kg) allowed all participants to safely imitate mistakes.I want to forecast the "class" with other predictors.
